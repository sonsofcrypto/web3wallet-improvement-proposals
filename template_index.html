        <section>
        <p>There are three main areas of focus for phase #2:
            <ul>
            <li> Continue to iterate on and to improve core wallet experience </li>
            <li>Android and Browser extension versions</li>
            <li>Integrations, both dapps and chains</li>
            </ul>
            It is important to note, all of this is subject to change, and proposals are unordered. You can comment on each proposal on <a href="https://github.com/sonsofcrypto/web3wallet-improvement-proposals/tree/master/proposals" target="_blank">github</a> and vote for it in our web3wallet app improvements proposals section, which can be found on our actions dashboard or via settings

        <h1 id="integrations">Integrations</h1>
        <p>warrant further elaboration, they are the stars of the show and the highlight of phase #2, and major differentiation. Our roadmap contains every popular category of defi / web3 products. Virtually all the products are considered blue chips on Ethereum. Here are some of the reasons why we chose this path forward:
        <ul>
            <li>They are the most battle-tested and secure and have survived the crashes and hacks that took place over past year relatively unscathed.</li>
            <li>They are all actually decentralized DAOs.</li>
            <li>One can't really claim to have native support for defi if you donâ€™t support the most popular products.</li>
            <li>Most, if not all, already have an ecosystem grants program.</li>
            <li>They have a large user base who are likely interested in the mobile versions of the product.</li>
            <li>Our core target audience already uses those products. They are likely to understand our mission and values. (ei their users are degens)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>There are some apps that integrate Uniswap swaps only, yet Uniswap also offers staking and yield farming. Not to mention that virtually all DAOs typically have a smart contract governance system (<a href="https://app-uniswap-org.ipns.dweb.link/#/vote">example</a>).
        What sets us apart is that we want to do &quot;deep&quot; integration, where we include all the different aspects of the dapp / protocol / chain. We know of no other wallet that offers such comprehensive integrations and we hope to win the hearts and minds of their community of users this way.</p>
        <p>We eventually want native support for as many dapps and chains as possible and this is why we will never stop adding new integrations, however, we think this is a great selection to start with.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h1 id="grown-and-marketing-stragy">Growth and Marketing strategy</h1>
        <p>We have adopted a content marketing strategy and plan to constantly be creating interesting, educational and entertaining content on at least a bi-weekly basis. We plan to collaborate and cross-promote with all the dapps and chains we integrate. This may take the form of co-hosted Twitter spaces, podcasts, tweets or articles.</p>
        <p>Our thinking is heavily influenced by this <a href="https://youtu.be/s0tfoW1N3VM?t=3239">video</a> (watch clip from: 54:03 to: 56:03). We will produce a new web3 trenches diary every two weeks where our audience can follow us along our journey through web3. We would love to have it evolve into a podcast allowing for industry leaders and members of our community to participate, contribute, learn and grow with us. This will require some preparation on our part like setting up an AI voice changer as a voice modulator often makes for heavy listening.</p>
        <p>We don&#39;t have budget at this stage for Google, FB ads spend YET! We do have great connections to some real and relevant heavyweights in the crypto space. We want to foster and grow all of these relationships. Ultimately if we win hearts and minds of crypto natives and influencers, marketing is going take care of itself. By Degens For Degens.</p>
