# WIP-2011 Rocket pool staking

Rocket Pool is a first of its kind ETH2 Proof of Stake Protocol, designed to be community owned, decentralised, trustless and compatible with staking in Ethereum 2.0. It was first conceived in late 2016 and has since had over 5 successful public betas over the life span of ETH2 development.

Rocket Pool is designed to cater to two main user groups; those that wish to participate in tokenised staking using rETH (opens new window)using as little as 0.01 ETH and those that wish to stake ETH and run a node in the network to help generate a higher ROI than staking outside of the protocol due to commissions earned.
