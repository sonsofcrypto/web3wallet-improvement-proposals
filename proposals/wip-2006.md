# WIP-2006 Uniswap deep integration

Add native support for
- Uniswap governance including forums
  - As part of this implement generic support for [Open Zeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance)'s Governor, GovernorAlpha, GovernorBravo and GovernorCompound contracts. These contracts cover governance for majority of Defi products out there. Adding governance support for rest of the dapps should require vitually no new code.
- Pools / Yield farming
  - Ability to view, deploy and manage pools
  - Ability to add / remove liquidity. View and collect rewards.
- Add support v2 pools swaps
  - Further refine AlphaRouter support
- (Optional) Support for Uniswap charts. This might have to be dropped.

This proposal could be summed up by saying. In apps native implementation for 
every part of uniswap product via interacting with smart contracts directly. 
Once we are done with this work we'll reach out to Uniswap devs, to see if they 
would be interested in some sort of collaboration.
